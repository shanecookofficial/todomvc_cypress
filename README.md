# Hi!
My name is Shane Cook and I am gradutating with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering April 2024 with an emphasis in Software Quality Assurance.

I am really excited to enter the work force so in preparation, I made this small software qa project revolving around the Cypress UI Automation tool and [ToDoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) to showcase my ability to write and execute test cases for a website.
